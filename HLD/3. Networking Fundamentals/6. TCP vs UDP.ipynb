    "\n",
    "Key responsibilities include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Segmentation and Reassembly**: Breaking large chunks of application data into smaller packets on the sender's side and reassembling them on the receiver's side.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Delivery Model**: Providing either a **reliable delivery service or a best-effort** transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flow and Congestion Control**: Managing the **rate of data transmission** to avoid overwhelming the receiver or the network itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where TCP and UDP diverge. TCP focuses on providing a **highly reliable, ordered stream of data**, while UDP prioritizes **speed and simplicity** with a best-effort approach."

    "**How TCP Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Connection Establishment (Three-Way Handshake)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before any data exchange can happen, **TCP establishes a connection between the client and server using a three-step handshake**. This ensures that both sides are ready and can communicate reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. SYN (Synchronize): The client initiates the connection by sending a SYN message, signaling its intent to start communication and sharing its initial sequence number (ISN).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. SYN-ACK (Synchronize–Acknowledge): The server receives the SYN, reserves resources for the connection, and responds with a SYN-ACK to acknowledge the request and share its own ISN.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. ACK (Acknowledge): The client sends an ACK to confirm receipt of the SYN-ACK, completing the handshake.\n",
    "At this point, both sides have synchronized sequence numbers, and a reliable communication channel is established.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Transfer**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the connection is established, TCP begins transmitting data. The protocol guarantees that all packets (segments) are delivered in order, without duplication, and without loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Segmentation: Large data is broken into smaller, manageable chunks called segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Acknowledgments (ACKs): Each segment sent is acknowledged by the receiver. If the sender doesn’t receive an ACK within a set timeout, it retransmits the segment.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Sliding Window: TCP uses a window-based flow control mechanism that allows multiple packets to be “in flight” before requiring an acknowledgment, improving throughput.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. Error Detection: Each segment includes a checksum to detect corruption in transit. Corrupted packets are discarded and resent.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In essence, TCP behaves like a reliable courier service: it delivers every packet, ensures they arrive in the right order, and resends any that get lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Connection Termination\n",
    "\n",
    "When communication is complete, TCP closes the connection gracefully through a four-step termination process. This ensures both client and server agree that the session is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. FIN (Finish): The client initiates termination, signaling it has no more data to send.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. ACK: The server acknowledges the FIN, allowing any remaining data to be processed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. FIN: The server sends its own FIN to close its side of the connection.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. ACK: The client confirms, and both sides release their resources.\n",
    "    \n",
